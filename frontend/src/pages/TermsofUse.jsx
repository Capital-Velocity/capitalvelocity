          Capital Velocity engages in several business services (the “Services”)

              loan category and specific lender(s) that offer the best
              opportunity for that business owner to prepare for and acquire a
              business loan. Once prepared, small business owners are then

          No Warranties. This section will apply to the maximum extent permitted
          by applicable law. Capital Velocity provides the services on an “as
          is” and “as available” basis and grants no warranties of any kind,
          whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise with respect to the
          services or the site (including all information contained therein),

          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Capital Velocity, its
          officers, directors, employees, agents and third parties, for any

          attorneys’ fees) relating to or arising out of (i) your use of or
          inability to use the Site or Services, (ii) any user postings made by
          you, (iii) your violation of any terms of these Terms or your

          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          <strong>8. Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration:</strong>
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Capital Velocity
          in the most expedient and cost-effective manner, you and Capital
          Velocity agree that either party, at any time, may opt to adjudicate
          their disputes through binding arbitration instead of in courts of
          general jurisdiction (“Agreement to Arbitrate”). Arbitration is more
          informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral
          arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, condenses discovery, and is
          subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the
          same damages and relief that a court can award. Any arbitration under
          these Terms will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations
          and class actions are not permitted. You acknowledge and agree that
          the arbitrator may award relief (including monetary, injunctive, and
          declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking
          relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated
          by that individual party’s claim(s). Any relief awarded cannot affect
          other users.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          You further agree and understand that any and all disputes, whether
          heard before a court of competent jurisdiction, or an arbitrator,
          shall be done solely on an individual basis, and that you
          affirmatively waive your right to participate in a class action to
          resolve any dispute (as defined below) that you may have with Capital
          Velocity.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          You understand that by entering into this agreement, you and Capital
          Velocity are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to
          participate in a class action:
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              Claims To Be Resolved By Binding Arbitration. You and Capital
              Velocity agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us.
              This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted.
              It includes, but is not limited to: claims arising out of or
              relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether
              based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any
              other legal theory; claims that arose before this or any prior
              Terms; claims that are currently the subject of purported class
              action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified
              class; and claims that may arise after the termination of these
              Terms.
            </li>
            <li>
              Exceptions. Notwithstanding Section 10(a), you and Capital
              Velocity agree that no statement herein shall be deemed to waive,
              preclude, or otherwise limit either party’s right to (i) pursue
              enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local
              agencies where such actions are available; (ii) seek injunctive
              relief in any competent court of law; or (iii) to file suit in a
              court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.
            </li>
            <li>
              Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and Capital Velocity will
              be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures
              (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration
              Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms, and will be
              administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are
              available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at
              1-800-778-7879.
            </li>

              Notice and Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must
              first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of
              Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to Capital Velocity should be
              addressed to: Capital Velocity, LLC., 6565 Spencer St. Suite 207,
              Las Vegas, NV 89119 (“Notice Address”). The Notice must (a)
              describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set
              forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). If you and Capital
              Velocity do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30
              days after the Notice is received, you or Capital Velocity may
              commence an arbitration proceeding.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fees. In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance
              with these Terms, Capital Velocity will, at your request,
              reimburse you for your payment of the arbitration filing fee,
              unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the
              payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules. Any request
              for payment of fees by Capital Velocity should be submitted by
              mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and Capital
              Velocity will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly
              to the AAA. In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s)
              you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous or brought for an
              improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in
              Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), you agree to reimburse
              Capital Velocity for all fees associated with the arbitration paid
              by Capital Velocity on your behalf that you otherwise would be
              obligated to pay under the AAA’s rules.
            </li>
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            If your claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the
            arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents
            submitted to the arbitrator, through a non-appearance based
            telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the
            AAA Rules.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Any in-person arbitration hearings will take place at a location to
            be agreed upon in Las Vegas, Nevada. Regardless of the manner in
            which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a
            reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential
            findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any,
            are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as
            to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time
            during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within
            14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.

              Claims To Be Resolved By Binding Arbitration. You and Capital
              Velocity agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us.

              other legal theory; claims that arose before this or any prior
              Terms; claims that are currently the subject of purported class
              action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified
              class; and claims that may arise after the termination of these
              Terms.
            </li>
            <li>
              Exceptions. Notwithstanding Section 10(a), you and Capital
              Velocity agree that no statement herein shall be deemed to waive,
              preclude, or otherwise limit either party’s right to (i) pursue
              enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local
              agencies where such actions are available; (ii) seek injunctive
              relief in any competent court of law; or (iii) to file suit in a
              court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.

          You agree to receive automated calls and text messages from Capital
          Velocity, even if you cancel your account or terminate your
          relationship with us, except if you opt- out (see below). You
          understand that you do not have to agree to receive automated
          promotional calls/texts as a condition of purchasing any goods or
          services or account creation. If you do not consent, you may email to

          final text message confirming your opt-out. We may use different
          shortcodes for different messaging purposes, so texting STOP to one
          shortcode will not effectuate a stop request for all shortcodes to
          which you are subscribed. If you would like to stop messages from

          out of automated calls or text messages, we reserve the right to make
          non-automated calls to you. It is possible that third parties may have
          your contact information and you may continue to receive
          communications from these third parties despite an opt out request. We
          are not responsible for unwanted contact from third parties. Please
          contact third parties directly to inform them of your communication
